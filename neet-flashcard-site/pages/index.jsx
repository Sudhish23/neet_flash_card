const flashcards = [
  { question: "What is the carbylamine test used for?", answer: "Detection of primary amines. Positive test gives foul-smelling isocyanide." },
  { question: "Which amines react with HNO2 to form stable diazonium salts?", answer: "Primary aromatic amines. Aliphatic ones give unstable diazonium salts." },
  { question: "Which type of reaction is typical in amines: nucleophilic or electrophilic?", answer: "Nucleophilic substitution is more common due to lone pair on nitrogen." },
  { question: "Where is ATP consumed in glycolysis?", answer: "1st step: Glucose to G6P; 3rd step: F6P to F1,6BP." },
  { question: "What is the role of NAD+ in cellular respiration?", answer: "It acts as an electron carrier, accepting electrons during glycolysis and TCA cycle." },
  { question: "Which step of TCA does not involve oxidation?", answer: "Succinyl-CoA to succinate â€” substrate level phosphorylation." },
  { question: "In which phase does centriole duplication occur?", answer: "G2 phase of cell cycle." },
  { question: "How much DNA is in a somatic cell after S-phase compared to a gamete?", answer: "Four times the DNA content." },
  { question: "What epithelium lines the PCT in nephron?", answer: "Brush border cuboidal epithelium." },
  { question: "Why do skeletal muscles appear striated?", answer: "Due to alternating pattern of actin and myosin filaments." },
  { question: "What is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum?", answer: "Calcium ions for muscle contraction." },
  { question: "What is a fascicle?", answer: "A bundle of muscle fibers wrapped in connective tissue." },
  { question: "Which enzyme breaks peptide bonds?", answer: "Protease." },
  { question: "Which bond does amylase act on?", answer: "Glycosidic bonds in starch." },
  { question: "Which amino acid is non-essential?", answer: "Alanine." },
  { question: "Which is a unicellular alga: Chlorella or Laminaria?", answer: "Chlorella." },
  { question: "Which plant group does Psilotum belong to?", answer: "Psilopsida (Pteridophyte)." },
  { question: "What is imbricate aestivation?", answer: "Overlapping sepals/petals without regular pattern." },
  { question: "What does Lucas test differentiate?", answer: "Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols by turbidity speed." },
  { question: "What is metamerism?", answer: "Isomerism due to different alkyl groups on either side of a functional group." },
  { question: "Which reactions show electrophilic substitution?", answer: "Typically aromatic compounds like benzene." }
